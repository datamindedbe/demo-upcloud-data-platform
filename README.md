# UpCloud data platform

This repo contains the code for building an open-source data platform on [UpCloud](https://upcloud.com/).

The data platform currently includes the following components:

- **[Trino](https://trino.io/)**: A distributed SQL engine for interactive queries across large and small datasets
  It allows us to build a data warehouse on UpCloud without depending on a managed service.
- **[Lakekeeper](https://docs.lakekeeper.io/)**: The production-ready metadata catalog for Iceberg tables, tightly integrated with Trino and OPA.
- **[Open policy agent (OPA)]()**: A general-purpose policy engine used here to enforce fine-grained data access control.
- **[Traefik](https://traefik.io/)**: A reverse proxy and ingress controller that manages SSL termination and routes traffic to the different services of our data platform.
- **[Zitadel](https://zitadel.com/)**: An identity and access management platform that handles user and application authentication, with support for integration into your companyâ€™s identity provider.

## Prerequisites
Before starting the deployment, make sure you have:

- A verified [UpCloud account](https://upcloud.com) with an API enabled subaccount for creating resources.
- A hosted domain and DNS provider (e.g., Route53, GoDaddy) for assigning a subdomain to the data platform stack.
- Installed [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/), [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), AWS CLI (for the S3-compatible object storage backend)
